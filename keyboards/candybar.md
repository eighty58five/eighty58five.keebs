Initially struggles to get keycaps to fit this and started off with a combination of Row 3 SA Keycaps that came with a Vortex vibe and left over modifiers from MITO's MT3 Dev/tty, before going with a full set of DEV/tty.

Finally settled on the White on Black MDA Keycaps from Idaboa,, although quickly explored TEXADA keycaps also before deciding to sell.

At this point I had decided that I did enjoy the 40% plus numpad layout but always preferred the look of 'The50' and seen a new group buy copming up so decided to sell so I coudl pursue it.
