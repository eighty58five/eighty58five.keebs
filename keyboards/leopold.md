This was my first adventure into Mechanical Keyboards. At the time leopold was known for it's great build quality and I was drawn in by the muted design with no logo's or fancy features.
I opted for brown switches as they only provide these in cherry options. I had experienc ef black in my RK61 and they felt a bit fatiguing. 
I also liked the tactility found in Lenovo laptops, so decided to try brown switches.

Whilst they are light and have fairly low tactility they were still a bit loud for office use.
I added some O-ring to help reduce the overall noise of the switches and keycaps.

The only modifications I may plan for this is a silent tactile switch and possibly upgrade to USB C and Bluetooth.
